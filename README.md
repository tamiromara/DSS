# **DSS:** **D**ata **S**cience **S**pecialization
These are my notes, code examples and general tips while being on the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1) on Coursera.

The repository and read me files will be updated weekly until the end of the course. I won't be posting the actual solutions to the assignments of course. Instead, i will slightly tweak the questions to produce similar examples to the ones that were given.

The Specialization is devided into 9 Courses + Capstone:
